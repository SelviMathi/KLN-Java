4.Write a  Program to print all the repeated elements in a sorted array.
5.Write a program to search an element in the given array and print the searched elements index. If no such elements were found print -1
6.You are given an array of 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of the array . 
Input array   =  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] 
Output array =  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
